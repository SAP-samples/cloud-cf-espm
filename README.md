# ESPM in Cloud Foundry

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cf-espm)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cf-espm)

The ESPM (Enterprise Sales & Procurement Model) application is a reference application which demonstrates how to build applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (Cloud Foundry) with the Java runtime. 

# Description

ESPM application has 2 underlying applications
- webshop: this application is a webshopping app, which does not have any authentication.
- retailer: this application is used by a retailer to manage stocks, approve/reject sales orders. We use authentication here.

For more details about the project, please refer to https://github.com/SAP/cloud-espm-v2 

# Requirements

- [Java8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [CF CLI](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/4ef907afb1254e8286882a2bdef0edf4.html)
- If you do not yet have a Cloud Foundry environment trial or enterprise account, signup for a Cloud Foundry environment trial account by following the [documentation](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html)
- To deploy the MTAR we need the MTA CF CLI plugin, download the MTA CF CLI Plugin from [here](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud)
- To build the multi target application, we need the [Cloud MTA Build tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/), download the tool from [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/download/).
	- For Windows system, install 'MAKE' from [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/makefile/)
	- Simplest way to install would be by running the command
		```
		npm install -g mbt
		```


# Download and Installation

### Running the application

**Note:** If you wish to deploy the application using MTA Build tool, then directly skip to the section [Building MTAR using MBT](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cf-espm#building-mtar-using-mbt)

#### 1. Login to Cloud Foundry

```
cf api <api>
cf login -o <org> -s <space>
```

#### 2. Create Service

ESPM application requires 2 backing services XSUAA  and HANA.

1. Create XSUAA service using the below command:

```
cf cs xsuaa application espm-uaa -c xs-security.json
```
> *Note:* Make sure the application name used in the xs-security.json is unique.

2. If you are using a SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) Cloudfoundry trial account then create the  HANA service following the below command
```
cf create-service hanatrial schema espm-hana
``` 

If you are using a productive SAP BTP Cloudfoundry account then create the required HANA services as mentioned below:

2.1 Create SAP HANA Cloud service instance with plan hana as described here : https://help.sap.com/viewer/9ae9104a46f74a6583ce5182e7fb20cb/hanacloud/en-US/784a1dbb421a4da29fb1e3bdf5f198ec.html

2.2 Create schema in SAP HANA Cloud Service instance(created in previous step) by creating an instance of the SAP HANA service broker by running the below command:

```
cf create-service hana schema espm-hana
```

> If there are multiple instances of SAP HANA Cloud Service in the space where you plan to deploy this application, please modify the  mta.yaml as shown below. Replace <database_guid> with the [id of the databse](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cc53ad464a57404b8d453bbadbc81ceb/Cloud/en-US/93cdbb1bd50d49fe872e7b648a4d9677.html?q=guid) you would like to bind the application with :

 ```
 # Hana Schema
  - name: espm-hana
    parameters:
      service: hana
      service-plan: schema
      config:
        database_id: <database_guid>
    type: com.sap.xs.hana-schema
```    

2.3 If you are using Hana, set the target database as Hana by [uncommenting the same in persistence.xml file](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cf-espm/blob/master/java/espm-cloud-jpa/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml#L10). 


#### 3. Edit Manifest

Open the manifest.yml file and edit the following:

```DATABASE_TYPE: <DB type>```

For HANA â€“ hana


#### 4. Build the application

Maven build the java application to package into a war file

From the root folder execute ```mvn clean install```


```
Note: Its no longer required to manually setup ngdbc since the following artifact is available in maven central and also the sap_java_buildpack provides the hana jdbc driver out-of-the-box.
``` 

#### 5. Install Dependencies

Go to web/resources/retailer and execute ```npm install```

Go to web/resources/webshop and execute ```npm install```

Make sure you have npm registry = "https://npm.sap.com/"

To setup the registry locally for each command, use the following

```npm install --registry=https://npm.sap.com/ -proxy=null```

#### 6. Push the application

```cf push -f manifest.yml```


#### 7. Setup Role collections

We need to setup the Role collections for the UAA, since the Retailer application needs the template role called "Retailer" assigned to the user, for the application to work.

 - In your trial account, in the left pane select Role collections under the Security tab.

 - Add a new Role collection named, "Retailer"

 - Click on the newly created "Retailer "role collection and add new Role.

 - Select the application identifier name similar to the one you have given in the xs-security.json file.

 - Select the role template and assign the Role you have created in the previous step.

#### 8. Assign Role to the user

We need to assign the role which we have created in the previous step to the user.

 - In your trial account, in the left pane select "Trust Configuration" under the Security tab.

 - Click on the default IDP service.

 - Enter username/email and click on the add Assignment button.

 - Select the Role as "Retailer" to assign it to the user.
	
#### 9. Accessing the application
	
To access the webshop page launch the given URL : `https://<your-application-ui-route>/webshop/index.html`

To access the retailer page launch the given URL : `https://<your-application-ui-route>/retailer/index.html`

# Security Implementation

![Security Diagram](/docs/images/ui-merge.jpg?raw=true)

Approuter has been binded to the XSUAA service.

Authentication Method specified in the xs-app.json file with

- Webshop - AuthenticationType: None

- Retailer - AuthenticationType: XSUAA

# Securing the Backend Application

To Secure the backend application, we need to bind the XSUAA service to the backend.

# Building MTAR using MBT
The ESPM application can be packaged as a [Multi Target Application](https://www.sap.com/documents/2016/06/e2f618e4-757c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html) which makes it easier to deploy the application. MTA application needs a [MTA Development descriptor](https://help.sap.com/viewer/4505d0bdaf4948449b7f7379d24d0f0d/2.0.03/en-US/4486ada1af824aadaf56baebc93d0256.html)(mta.yml) which is used to define the elements and dependencies of multi-target application. 

Build the application by running following command from root folder of the project: `mbt build -p=cf`
	
# Deploy MTAR
If CF MTA Plugin is not installed, intall if  from [here](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud)

To Deploy the application navigate to mta_archives folder under your project root folder and run the below command from CLI

	cf deploy ESPM_MTA_1.0.0.mtar

# Accessing the application
	
To access the webshop page launch the given URL : `https://<your-application-ui-route>/webshop/index.html`

To access the retailer page launch the given URL : `https://<your-application-ui-route>/retailer/index.html`
